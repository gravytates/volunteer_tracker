# Volunteer Tracker

Ruby week 3 code review covering database basics and psql

## Description

This website is built for the humble non-profit employee! You can create, view, update, and delete projects! You can create volunteer profiles and assign them to projects as well to help keep track of progress. Hours can be added and edited for an individual volunteer, and project hours are totaled as well. Sort volunteers and projects alphabetically or by hours contributed. Website uses postgres and psql for databases and data queries.

### Prerequisites

Web browser with ES6 compatibility
Examples: Chrome, Safari

Ruby 2.2.2
Bundler
Postgres

### Installing

Installation is not quick, nor particularly easy. First ensure you have Postgres installed. Then:

* Navigate to terminal and run the following commands to set up your databases:
  * CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker;
  * \c volunteer_tracker;
  * CREATE TABLE projects (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar);
  * CREATE TABLE volunteers (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar);
  * CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker_test with template volunteer_tracker;

Second, clone this repository to your machine, navigate to the file path in your terminal, and run 'app.rb' by typing '$ruby app.rb'. Now just copy the localhost path into your web browser. The standard localhost for Sinatra is port 4567 (eg: localhost:4567)

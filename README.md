## Description


### Prerequisites

Web browser with ES6 compatibility
Examples: Chrome, Safari

Ruby 2.2.2
Bundler

### Installing

Installation is not quick, nor particularly easy. First ensure you have Postgres installed.

* Navigate to terminal and run the following commands to set up your databases:
  * CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker;
  * \c volunteer_tracker;
  * CREATE TABLE projects (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar);
  * CREATE TABLE volunteers (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar);
  * CREATE DATABASE volunteer_tracker_test with template volunteer_tracker;



First clone this repository to your machine, navigate to the file path in your terminal, and run 'app.rb' by typing '$ruby app.rb'. If you chose to clone the repository, after you run 'app.rb' you will need to copy the localhost path into your web browser. The standard localhost for Sinatra is port 4567
